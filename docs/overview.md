# ImperiumOS Quantum Defence AI  

## ðŸŒŒ Overview  
ImperiumOS is a **next-generation Quantum Cyber Defense AI** designed to simulate and defend against evolving threats in the cyber domain.  
This repository contains a **safe public demo** that shows how the AI can detect and neutralize simulated attacks.  

## ðŸš€ Features in This Demo  
- Runs a **simulation of 3 random cyber threats**  
- Demonstrates **detection + defense protocol**  
- Completely safe â€” no real hacking or defense logic  

## ðŸ›¡ Real Project Notes  
- The **core AI logic, datasets, and secure algorithms** are private and not published here.  
- This repo is only for **demo + documentation**.  

## ðŸ“‚ Structure  
- `main.py` â†’ Demo simulation code  
- `docs/overview.md` â†’ Project overview and description  

## ðŸ”® Future Plans  
- Expand demo with visualization of attacks/defenses  
- Add modular AI components  
- Keep private core logic in separate **secure repos**
